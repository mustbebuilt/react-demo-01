## React Example

### Passing Values between Components

`npm install`

Run with:

`npm start`

### Application Logic

This sample application includes three React components: `App`, `ItemList`, and `ItemDetails`. These components work together to create a simple application for displaying a list of items and allowing the user to view the details of a selected item. Below is an explanation of each component:

1. **App.js**

   - This is the main component of your React application. It serves as the root component that renders other components and manages the state of the selected item.

   - `useState` is imported from React to manage the state. The `selectedItemId` state variable is used to keep track of the ID of the currently selected item. It is initialized to `null` to indicate that no item is initially selected.

   - `items` is an array that simulates a list of items. Each item is an object with an `_id`, a `name`, and `details`.

   - `handleItemSelect` is a function that gets called when a user clicks the "Show Details" button in the `ItemList` component. It takes the `itemId` as an argument and updates the `selectedItemId` state with the ID of the selected item.

   - The `return` statement renders the components. It displays the "My App" heading, the `ItemList` component, and the `ItemDetails` component. However, it only displays the `ItemDetails` component if a `selectedItemId` is set (not null). It passes the selected item's ID and the list of items as props to the `ItemDetails` component.

2. **ItemList.js**

   - The `ItemList` component is responsible for rendering a list of items and handling user interactions with those items.

   - It receives `items` and `onItemSelect` as props from its parent (`App`).

   - Inside the `return` statement, it maps through the `items` array and renders each item's name along with a "Show Details" button.

   - When the "Show Details" button is clicked, it calls the `onItemSelect` function with the item's ID as an argument, which is defined in the parent `App` component. This function is used to update the `selectedItemId` in the `App` component.

3. **ItemDetails.js**

   - The `ItemDetails` component is responsible for displaying the details of the selected item.

   - It receives the `itemId` and `items` props from its parent (`App`).

   - The component uses the `find` method to locate the selected item within the `items` array based on the provided `itemId`. If the selected item is found, it displays the details; otherwise, it displays a message indicating that the item was not found.

   - The displayed details are obtained from the selected item's `details` property and rendered in the JSX.

The code appears to be correctly structured, and the communication between these components is well-defined. The issue you mentioned in your previous question about item details not changing should be resolved with the updated `ItemDetails` component that uses the `find` method to locate the selected item based on the provided `itemId`. This ensures that the details of the selected item are correctly displayed.
